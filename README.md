Phone a friend was [originally my senior project](https://github.com/PhoneAFriend/android) developed with a 4 person team for Android and IOS.  
 <br>       
I am redoing Phone A Friend here as a web app for learning and practice with a full stack using React.  

What's next for PhoneAFriend:  
Comments  
Users  
Authentication  
          

Completed so far:   
Posts CRUD without Authentication.
