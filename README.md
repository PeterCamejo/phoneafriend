Phone a friend was [originally my senior project](https://github.com/PhoneAFriend/android) developed with a 4 person team for Android and IOS.  
     
I am redoing Phone A Friend here as a web app for learning and practicing with a full stack using React.  
  
Phone-a-Friend is an application wherein users can ask and answer questions in a Stack Overflow-like format, as well as connect in private sessions to utilize text chat and a drawing tool to help further tutor one another in cases where a user needs more of a hands-on approach to answer their posted question.  
  

**What's next for PhoneAFriend:  **   
Update and work on styling    
Tutor Sessions  
            

**Completed so far: **
